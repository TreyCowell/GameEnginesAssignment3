# INFR 3110U Game Engine Design Assignment 02

# Game Description
RAOITGDC's planned GDW game does not really need the implementation of a level editor because our levels are going to be premade
and our game is going to be a dark Asymmetric multiplayer horror game.
So for this assignment we just made a base prototype in which we can add playable elements too for the next assignment coming up,
such as a moving character, sound etc...
