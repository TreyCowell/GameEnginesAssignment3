# INFR 3110U Game Engine Design Assignment 03

# Game Description
RAOITGDC's planned GDW game does not really need the implementation of a level editor because our levels are going to be premade
and our game is going to be a dark Asymmetric multiplayer horror game.
Since we need to spice up the gameplay element our our previous assignment, I added a moving player and a goal for the players to complete.
I also added some rocks to the scene to give it some life
